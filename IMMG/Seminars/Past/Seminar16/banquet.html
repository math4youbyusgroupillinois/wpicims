<h3>History</h3><br>

<p>Since 1289 wine production with passion, dedication and fun is part of the family Minges, the owners of the <a href="http://www.weingut-marienhof.de/de/index.htm">Vinery Marienhof</a>.</p>

<p>In the early 60s Rudolf and Agnes Minges settled with their winery in the middle of the vineyards, outside Flemlingen and expanded continuously the permanent establishment.</p>
