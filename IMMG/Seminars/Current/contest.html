<h2>Student Contest</h2>
<br />
<h3>Background</h3>
<div>
  <p>
Feedback from the previous Seminars in this series indicates that they have been an experience particularly valuable for graduate students, giving them the opportunity to present results of their research, learn about ongoing projects in the field, meet academics and industrialists engaged in modeling business, and form useful connections with them.

The Grants will be awarded to two best student papers (as judged by the Program Committee) submitted before the seminar deadline of February 6, 2014. The selection for the best students' contributions will be done in accordance with the criteria of <b><i>clarity</b></i>,<b><i> novelty</b> </i> and <b><i>innovation</b></i>.
