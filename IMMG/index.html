<h2>IMMG as a Division of CIMS</h2>
<p>WPI's Center for Industrial Mathematics and Statistics brings together academic research with actual problems facing today's industry.</p>
<p>CIMS' (and hence IMMG's) activities are aiming at:</p>

<ul>
<li>enhancing the technological competitiveness of its industrial partners,</li>
<li>enriching the expertise of the faculty and the value of the students' education.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technical Area</h2>
<p>The Industrial Microwave Modeling Group (IMMG) is concerned with outstanding issues in microwave engineering (including its non-communication domain). In its works, the Group relies on state-of-the-art mathematical modeling, scientific computations, and optimization applied to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Multiphysics processes and complex systems of microwave power engineering,</li>
<li>Broadband/multiband antennas and radiating systems, and</li>
<li>Nondestructive evaluation and testing of materials.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<p>The IMMG activities offer a variety of educational opportunities for students who might join the related sectors in industry after graduation and bring to it their professional experience in modeling and computation.</p>
<p> On the other hand, industrialists involved with  microwave engineering and its applications may benefit from the IMMG unique expertise, international seminars and variety of educational opportunities.</p>
