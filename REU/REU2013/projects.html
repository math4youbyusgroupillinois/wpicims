Our project focuses on developing meaningful patterns from GenomeQuest's customer usage data files through the use of the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process.  We are looking for patterns within their customer usage keeping track of patterns among regions and types of clientele along with any other grouping.  This involves extensive processing and transformation of the data to apply various data mining techniques to distinguish patterns.  We are using multiple data mining techniques including logistic regression, decision trees, decision forests, clustering, association rules and neural networks.  The procedure and application to our project of each technique is examined along with preliminary results.

As a product is manufactured, it is subject to multiple sources of variation. Manufacturers use tolerance stack-up analysis to predict how often the accumulated variation of individual parts will compromise the functionality of the final product. Our goal is to create a model in Microsoft Excel that uses Monte Carlo methods to simulate these variations and provide information about the potential feasibility of a product. With these results, engineers can make necessary changes to the production or assembly process. We are developing such a model in Excel to make conducting simulation and tolerance stack-up analysis affordable and broadly accessible.

Familial ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) is an inheritable neurodegenerative disease affecting nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.  Our project is on statistical methodology development and data analysis for the most cutting-edge genetic data from exome sequencing and genome-wide association studies of familial ALS. After exploring over fifteen methods for analyzing this type of data, we have determined four methods, which we believe to be the most efficacious: C-alpha, Replication Based Testing, Joint-Rank Method, and Variable Threshold Method. We also aim to develop new methods based on Rank Truncated Product test.  Combining biological prior information, we are now applying these methods to our data, and we hope to find new evidence of familial ALS gene associations.
