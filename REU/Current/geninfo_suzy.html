<h2>Meals</h2>
<p>You can either prepare your own meals, or you can buy meals from the WPI Dining Services.</p>
<p>A meal plan is offered during the summer term by the <a href="/Admin/Dining/">WPI Dining Services</a>. The plan was designed for the WPI Summer Session and provides three meals a day on the Mon-Fri. The meal plan doesn't cover weekends and stops before the REU does.</p>
<p>For information about the meal plan please contact <a href="mailto:rpodell@wpi.edu">Rhonda Podell</a>.</p>
<p>You can also pay for meals on a per meal basis. The best way to do this is by purchasing Cash Points which will be placed on your WPI ID card. Cash Points are better than cash if you are eating at the WPI Dining Services because you get an automatic 10% discount when using Cash Points. Unused Cash Points are refundable. You can buy Cash Points at anytime once you are here. If you are planning on eating on campus more than you cook or eat out then Cash Points are advisable.</p>
<p>Cooking is probably going to be everybody's choice. The apartments each have a full kitchen, but you must bring your own cookware: pots, pans, dish ware.</p>

<h2>Campus Services</h2>
<p>For your stay here you will have access to all the campus facilities just like every other WPI student. You will be able to use all the <a href="/academics/Depts/PE/Facilities/">athletic facilities</a> such as Alumni Gym, the Fitness Center, and the pool during the open session hours. You will have full access to the <a href="/academics/CCC">Campus Computing Center</a>'s resources, once you receive your computer accounts.</p>

<h2>Food</h2>
