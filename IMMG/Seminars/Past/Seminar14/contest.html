<h2>Travel Grants for Graduate Students</h2>
<br />
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Feedback from the previous Seminars in this series indicates that they have been an experience particularly valuable for graduate students, giving them the opportunity to present results of their research, learn about ongoing projects in the field, and to form useful connections with researchers.</p>

<h3>Contest for Travel Support</h3>
<p>In acknowledgment of this, and in order to further support this trend and make it easier for students to attend the 14th Seminar, we are pleased to announce the availability of <strong>three travel grants in the amount of 150 Euros each</strong>, which will be awarded to the three best student papers (as judged by the program committee) submitted before the seminar deadline of January 9, 2012.</p>

<h3>Terms and Conditions</h3>
<p>Students wishing to enter the competition for these awards should use the standard submission procedure outlined on the <a href="submitAbstract.html">Submit Abstract</a> page, and should check the appropriate box on the submission form to indicate that they wish to be considered in this competition.</p>
<p>The grants are to be given to the winners in the form of cash upon the students' presentations at the seminar. Seminar registration fee cannot be waived for the winners of the travel grants.</p>

<h3>Acknowledgment</h3>
<p>The Organizing and Program Committee is very grateful to the sponsor of this Contest, the <a href="http://www.ampereeurope.org">Association for Microwave Power in Europe for Research and Education (AMPERE)</a> for responding to the related initiative and affording this special opportunity to students at this event.</p>
