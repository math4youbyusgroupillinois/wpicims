<h3>Seminar Profile</h3>
<br />

<p>
This meeting is focused on the <strong>topics in computational high frequency electromagnetics</strong> and 
should attract <i>engineers, researchers and students working/interested in this discipline.</i>
</p> 

<p>
A specific driving force of this Seminar is the upcoming availability of the 3D conformal 
FDTD simulator <i>QuickWave-3D</i>/<i>Concerto</i>, one of the most powerful electromagnetic modeling software on 
the market today, in teaching and research activities of the WPI's Electrical and Computer 
Engineering Department.
</p>

<p>
The event is therefore designed to briefly expose the interested faculty and students 
to fundamentals of the underlying numerical technique, concepts of its implementation, 
principles of application of the software, and examples of its employments in research 
and engineering projects.
</p>

<p>
The seminar consists of a series of extended talks given by:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	a world renowned expert in time-domain techniques for microwave systems 
	(who, at the same time, is one of the key authors of <i>QuickWave-3D</i>), and
	</li>
	<li>
	members of WPI's Industrial Microwave Modeling Group (IMMG), a division 
	of Center for Industrial Mathematics and Statistics (CIMS) of the WPI's 
	Department of Mathematical Sciences.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
The IMMG has been using this modeling software in research and student projects 
since 1999; this event features the talks about some recent IMMG 
projects employing <i>QuickWave-3D</i> as a generator of data for the algorithms 
performing microwave optimization and solving microwave inverse 
problems.
</p>

<p>
While it is structured as an "internal" university event, the seminar is open 
to professionals outside WPI. <strong><i>Academics and industrialists, researchers and 
engineers, students of different level</i></strong>, everybody interested in computational 
electromagnetics and, more specifically, time-domain techniques and FDTD simulations, 
those who wish to learn what this type of modeling can provide are invited to attend.
</p>
