<h2>Student Contest</h2>
<br />
<h3>Background</h3>
<div>
<p>Feedback from the previous Seminars in this series indicates that they have been an experience particularly valuable for graduate students, giving them the opportunity to present results of their research, learn about ongoing activities in the field, and to form useful connections with researchers.</p>
</div>

<h3>Contest for Travel Support</h3>
<div>
<p>In acknowledgment of this, and in order to further support this trend and make it easier for students to attend the 16th Seminar in Karlsruhe, the Organizing Committee is pleased to announce the availability of <b><i>two grants</i></b> (in the amount of 150 Euros each) aiming to cover a part of the related travel expenses. The grants will be awarded to two best student papers (as judged by the designated members of the Program Committee) submitted before the seminar deadline of April 11, 2014.</p>
<p>The grants will be given to the winners at the Closing Session upon the students' presentations at the Seminar.</p>
</div>
