<h3>Transportation to Karlsruhe</h3>
<div>
<b><i>By plane</b></i>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.badenairpark.de/">Baden-Airpark</a> is the nearest local airport, about 40km from the city. The airport is now served by low-cost carrier Ryanair, which offers cheap flights to several European destinations. There is a cheap shuttle bus (<a href="http://www.baden-airpark-express.de/">Baden-Airport-Express</a>) (leaving between two and four times a day on weekdays, not running on weekends at all, and not synchronized with the flight schedule) between the airport and Karlsruhe Main Station. One-way-tickets can be bought from the driver (10 EUR, cash only, accepted currency: euro); alternatively, you can take a train or a tram-train to Rastatt or Baden-Baden and take a connecting bus to Baden-Airport. Through-ticketing is available, for current prices and schedules see <a href="http://www.kvv.de/">Karlsruher Verkehrsverbund</a> (Karlsruhe Area Mass Transit Authority)</li> 

<li>Frankfurt airport is Germany's biggest airport and is served by all major carriers that operate in Germany. It has a direct ICE high speed train connection to Karlsruhe (1 hour).</li>

<li>Stuttgart airport is reachable by train in one and a half hour.</li>
</ul>

<b><i>By train</i></b>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The train station (<i>Karlsruhe Hauptbahnhof</i>) is located south of the city center, with roughly 5-10 minutes by tram to the central Market Square. Karlsruhe is well linked to other cities by ICE high speed trains. The schedules for the inter-city connections can be obtained from the <a href="http://www.bahn.de/i/view/GBR/en/index.shtml">Deutsche Bahn</a> (German railroads). </p>

<b><i>By car</i></b>
<p>Karlsruhe has several exits from the A5 autobahn, approximately 130 km south of Frankfurt. The A8 joins the A5 just south of the city, connecting to Stuttgart 80 km east.</p>

<h3>Public Transport in Karlsruhe</h3>

<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Karlsruhe has an excellent public transportation system called KVV; it is mostly built on tram-trains (<i>stadtbahn</i>).This allows trains to run on tram track within the city or on railway track to serve the surrounding areas. An overview of the entire transport network can be downloaded from the <a href="http://www.kvv.de/fileadmin/user_upload/kvv/dokumente/netz/liniennetz/2012/L0SCHI_SEP12_Internet.pdf">KVV transport network</a>. KVV offices (located at the main train station and at Marktplatz) can be helpful with ticketing. Trains run late into the night. Schedules and maps are posted on virtually every station; one can also find more information on fares and timetables on the <a href="http://en.kvv.de">KVV web site</a>.</p>
