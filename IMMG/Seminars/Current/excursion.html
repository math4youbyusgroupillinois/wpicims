			<h4>The Karlsruhe bioliq速 Process</h4>
The bioliq速 pilot plant will cover the process chain required for producing customized fuels from residual biomass. Being mainly synthesized from dry straw or wood, the biomass to liquid fuels offer environmental and climatic benefits through clean combustion. The integrative process chain, moreover, enables production of synthesis gas and chemicals.

			<h4>Gyrotron Test Facility</h4>
Part of the Fusion Energy Program at KIT is the design and development of high power microwave sources. Those are used in experiments on controlled nuclear fusion in magnetic confined plasmas for plasma ignition, plasma heating and plasma stabilization. Such gyrotron sources operate at frequencies in the hundred GHz range and at power levels up to 2 MW.

			<h4>HEPHAISTOS Experimental Center (HEC)</h4>
The modular microwave product line HEPHAISTOS represents a radical innovation in the field of heating and process systems for material treatment. These chamber systems provide an excellent homogeneous field distribution. The generation of uniform and homogeneous fields at 2.45 GHz over a wide area has been a key problem of industrial microwave technology. There are several HEPHAISTOS microwave systems (up to 7500 l in volume) available for industrial process development.
