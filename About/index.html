<h1>About CIMS</h1>

<p>
The problems facing business and industry are growing ever more complex. Often, the solution of these highly technical problems involves sophisticated mathematics that may tax a company's internal resources. The Center for Industrial Mathematics and Statistics was created as a mathematical resource to industry. The faculty <a href="members.html">members</a> and students associated with the Center have the expertise to address today's complex problems.
</p>

<p>
Faculty and students associated with CIMS have worked with local companies on more than thirty projects at the graduate and undergraduate level.
</p>

<p>
In addition to developing projects and industrial contacts for WPI students and faculty, CIMS has taken a leadership role by organizing various activities for the benefit of the applied/industrial mathematics community.
