<h2>Motivations</h2>
<p>Despite overwhelming technological progress, many microwave power processes/systems are still developed on the basis of <i>extensive experimentation</i>. This usually requires utilization of substantial resources and makes <i>an unavoidable impact on the cost</i> of the final products.</p>
<p>Practical techniques of mathematical modeling and optimization</i> may be of enormous help in improving this situation, but, overall, they remain poorly involved in routine use in the industrial environment.</p>

<h2>Strategic Goals</h2>
<p>The Group works towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>moving communications between microwave industries and academic institutions specialized in math/computer modeling on a higher level, and</li>
<li>making modeling more usable to reduce the cost of production and improve equipment characteristics.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Operations</h2>
<p>The Group:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>helps industry realize the benefits</i> of applicable computational opportunities and encourages to use them for modeling and optimization,</li>
<li>assists in microwave businesses to <i> formulate their problems suitable for CAD and work towards their computer-driven resolutions. </i> </li>
<p> These operations are carried out in the forms of educational activities, R&D programs and cooperative efforts in modeling and designing microwave processes and systems. </p>
</ul>
