<h1>General Information for 2013</h1>
<br />

<h2>Financial Support</h2>
<p>We are able to provide a $4300 stipend and housing for the length of the program. We will also have some funds available to defray the cost of travel, and to support a limited number of students participate in the annual AMS/MAA meeting for presenting their REU projects.</p>

<h2>Housing and Room Services</h2>
<p>Students will be living in the Fuller apartment complex. These are on-campus apartments owned by WPI. They both have a full kitchen and living room on the first floor, with bedrooms on the second floor. A one time supply of bed linens will be provided, so you don't have to bring bed sheets with you. Cable service is available in every room. Local phone service will be provided, long-distance calls can be made with a phone card. Computer connections to the WPI network are available.</p>

<h2>Finding the House...</h2>
<p>First get to WPI, here are some <a href="/About/Visitors/directions.html#worcester">directions</a>.</p>
<p>Now to get to the Fuller apartments from the main WPI campus entrance which is at the intersection of West Street and Institute Road.</p>
<p>Stay on Institute Road and the Fuller apartments will be on your left about half way up the hill. They are on the corner of Institute and Trowbridge streets. There is a parking lot on Institute road right behind the apartment complex.</p>

<h2>Mail</h2>
<p>Your mailing address will be:</p>
<p>Name<br />
REU Program<br />
c/o WPI Department of Mathematical Sciences<br />
100 Institute Road<br />
Worcester MA, 01609-2280</p>

<h2>Meals</h2>
<p>You can either prepare your own meals, or you can buy meals from the WPI Dining Services.</p>
<p>A meal plan is offered during the summer term by the <a href="/Admin/Dining/">WPI Dining Services</a>. The plan was designed for the WPI Summer Session and provides three meals a day on the Mon-Fri. The meal plan doesn't cover weekends and stops before the REU does.</p>
<p>For information about the meal plan please contact <a href="mailto:rpodell@wpi.edu">Rhonda Podell</a>.</p>
<p>You can also pay for meals on a per meal basis. The best way to do this is by purchasing Cash Points which will be placed on your WPI ID card. Cash Points are better than cash if you are eating at the WPI Dining Services because you get an automatic 10% discount when using Cash Points. Unused Cash Points are refundable. You can buy Cash Points at anytime once you are here. If you are planning on eating on campus more than you cook or eat out then Cash Points are advisable.</p>
<p>Cooking is probably going to be everybody's choice. The apartments each have a full kitchen, but you must bring your own cookware: pots, pans, dish ware.</p>

<h2>Campus Services</h2>
<p>For your stay here you will have access to all the campus facilities just like every other WPI student. You will be able to use all the <a href="/academics/Depts/PE/Facilities/">athletic facilities</a> such as Alumni Gym, the Fitness Center, and the pool during the open session hours. You will have full access to the <a href="/academics/CCC">Campus Computing Center</a>'s resources, once you receive your computer accounts.</p>
